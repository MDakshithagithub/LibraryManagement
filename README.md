# LibraryManagement
A library Management System, also known as an automated library system is a software that has been developed to handle basic housekeeping functions of a library. It is a well
organised software solution for a library. It helps to provide information on any book present in the library to the user as well as staff members. It keeps a track of books issued, returned and added to the library.Books and students maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep track of the students using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library contains,thus helping the librarian to manage the library.

This Library Management System Project is developed in Java, to provide all the features that a Library Management System should usually have and overcome the drawbacks of the present system such as:
● Paper-based record keeping.
● Mis-management of data due to manual and paper-based handling.
● A vast amount of time consumption in searching for books and library management.
● Book-thefts from the library
